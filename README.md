## 📘 **Project Documentation: Book Marketplace App**

**Name: BookSwap**
**Version:** 1.0
---

### 🧠 1. **Overview**

A smart, community-driven platform where users can **buy, sell, or rent books** locally. The app simplifies listing books through **AI scanning**, enables **cart and secure payment**, and includes features like **map-based discovery**, **chat between buyers and sellers**, and **order/rental management**.

---

### 🎯 2. **Problem Statement**
Students, readers, and book lovers struggle to find affordable, accessible, and sustainable ways to buy, rent, or sell books locally.

New books are expensive. Old books often go to waste. Renting isn't common or easy. And selling used books online is clunky, manual, and inconvenient.

Meanwhile, there's no trusted, community-driven marketplace that connects nearby buyers and sellers of academic and personal books—with features tailored for ease, trust, and speed.

And so, we are here : 
We make books affordable, accessible, and reusable by connecting local communities through a smart, sustainable, and student-friendly book marketplace.
